# Selected Text Editor
This program allows for editing of selected text in a window before copy/pasting.
It's useful when copying commands/code from websites, since most of these commands
will have placeholders like `path/to/your/file` and `email@example.com`. Since it's
especially annoying to edit text once pasted in a terminal window, this program
allows for editing in a Tkinter Text window, and then ctrl+c can be used to copy the
edited text and to close the window.
